## Oligo Security Overview

### AppSec Like You’ve Never Seen It Before
Oligo Security observes application behavior to uncover real risks and prevent breaches before they happen. Their platform provides actionable insights and real-time detection, helping organizations focus on vulnerabilities that are truly exploitable.

### Key Features
- **Detect**: Identify attacks instantly.
- **Observe**: Visualize true exploitability with evidence.
- **Monitor**: Track application behavior at the library and function levels.

### Oligo Products
#### Oligo Focus
Oligo Focus helps developers prioritize vulnerabilities that are actually exploitable, reducing unnecessary work on non-critical findings. By focusing on executed vulnerable functions, Oligo keeps developers focused on features, not fixes.

- **Pinpoint Real Exploits**: Focus on vulnerabilities that are actively used in the application.
- **Noise Reduction**: Eliminate false positives and non-exploitable findings.
- **Automation**: Automate SBOM and VEX reporting for compliance and customer requests.
  
#### Oligo ADR
Oligo ADR provides real-time detection and response to application-layer attacks. Using library-level behavioral profiles, Oligo identifies anomalies and exploitation attempts, even from zero-day vulnerabilities.

- **Catch Attacks Early**: Identify attacks at the library level before they escalate.
- **Detect Zero-Day Exploits**: Determine whether your application is already impacted by newly disclosed vulnerabilities.
- **Real-Time Response**: Stop attacks in progress to prevent costly breaches.
